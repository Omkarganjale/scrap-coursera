4,Business,Fundamentals of Project Planning and Management,"Projects are all around us. Virtually every organization runs projects, either formally or informally. We are engaged in projects at home and at work. Across settings, planning principles and execution methodologies can offer ways in which projects can be run more effectively and efficiently. Project management provides organizations (and individuals) with the language and the frameworks for scoping projects, sequencing activities, utilizing resources, and minimizing risks.This is an introductory course on the key concepts of planning and executing projects. We will identify factors that lead to project success, and learn how to plan, analyze, and manage projects. Learners will be exposed to state-of-the-art methodologies and to considering the challenges of various types of projects.SHOW ALL COURSE OUTLINESHOW ALL","How to initiate, define and organize a project.

5,Business,Successful Negotiation: Essential Strategies and Skills,"We all negotiate on a daily basis. On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers and employers, among others. Negotiation is also the key to business success. No business can survive without profitable contracts. Within a company, negotiation skills can lead to your career advancement. I hope that you will join the hundreds of thousands of learners who have made “Successful Negotiation” one of the most popular and highly-rated MOOCs worldwide.  In the course, you’ll learn about and practice the four steps to a successful negotiation: 

   (1) Prepare: Plan Your Negotiation Strategy 

   (2) Negotiate: Use Key Tactics for Success 

   (3) Close: Create a Contract 

   (4) Perform and Evaluate: The End Game 

To successfully complete this course and improve your ability to negotiate, you’ll need to do the following: 

(1) Watch the short videos (ranging from 5 to 20 minutes). The videos are interactive and they include questions to test your understanding of negotiation strategy and skills. You can speed up or slow down videos to match your preferred pace for listening. Depending on your schedule, you can watch the videos over a few weeks or you can binge watch them. A learner who binge-watched the course concluded that “It’s as good as Breaking Bad.” Another learner compared the course to “House of Cards.”  Both shows contain interesting examples of complex negotiations!

(2) Test your negotiation skills by completing the negotiation in Module 6. You can negotiate with a local friend or use Discussions to find a partner from another part of the world. Your negotiation partner will give you feedback on your negotiation skills. To assist you with your negotiations, I have developed several free negotiating planning tools that are related to the course.  These tools and a free app are available at http://negotiationplanner.com/ 

(3) Take the final exam. To successfully complete the course, you must answer 80% of the questions correctly. The exam is a Mastery Exam, which means that you can take it as many times as you want until you master the material.

6,Business,"Brand Management: Aligning Business, Brand and Behaviour","Professor Nader Tavassoli of London Business School contrasts traditional approaches to branding - where brands are a visual identity and a promise to customers - to brands as a customer experience delivered by the entire organisation. The course offers a brand workout for your own brands, as well as guest videos from leading branding professionals. The aim of the course is to change the conception of brands as being an organisation's visual identity (e.g., logo) and image (customers' brand associations) to an experience along ""moments-that-matter"" along the customer journey and, therefore, delivered by people across the entire organisation. Brands are thus not only an external promise to customers, but a means of executing business strategy via internal brand-led behaviour and culture change.

You will learn and practice the following skills:

1.	How to build brands from a broad organisational perspective 
2.	How to lead brand-led culture change with human resource practices at the core (i.e., brand as a lever and not just an outcome) 
3.	How to build brands in multi-brand companies, across cultures and geographies
4.	How to measure brand health in new ways, that is, internally in addition to externally
5.	How to value and capture returns to brands across the organisation - introducing the new concept of employee-based brand equity - and how this is different from the valuation of brands as intangible assets. 

This course allows you to develop the following aspects of yourself:

1.	Head. Gain a deeper understanding of the evolving practice of brand management, one that goes further than practiced in most organisations today
2.	Heart. Be motivated to engage in delivering your own brands – regardless of where you are in your organisation – thereby creating superior value for customers and for your organisation
3.	Hands. Translate learnings into action. As Confucius is supposed to have said: “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.”SHOW ALL COURSE OUTLINESHOW ALL",NA,Corporate Branding. Brand Marketing. Brand Management.

7,Business,Impact Measurement & Management for the SDGs,"How can businesses and investors help fill the multi-trillion dollar gap needed for sustainable development? Simply put, by getting better at measuring and managing impacts on people and planet. Through this course, anyone can learn to improve their organization's practice of impact management, and how to align their ESG or impact activities and reporting with emerging global standards. Impact Measurement and Management for the SDGs is sponsored by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the global development network of the United Nations which created the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that over 190 countries have signed on to achieve by 2030.  But the public sector can't do this alone. Climate change, poverty, racial and gender equity, food, health, education, clean water --  the list of challenges faced by people and planet is too long. Business and investment have stepped in to help. But in a field of evolving acronyms, standards and systems, many are not exactly sure what is required to do this work well. Third party standards and certifications are also evolving quickly to verify and assure impact management practices. What do you need to know to align your work with impact on the SDGs in ways that meet evolving expectations?

Produced by the award winning team at CASE at Duke University, and developed in collaboration with advisors from around the world, this course consolidates several decades of work around impact management into a cutting-edge guide based on short videos and lessons with concrete practical examples.   The course emphasizes ways to improving decision-making for impact on SDGs through changes enterprises and investors can make in strategy, management approach, transparency, and governance, which we have translated into 4 universal practices of impact measurement and management  - SET STRATEGY, INTEGRATE, OPTIMIZE and REINFORCE. These steps are aligned with the UNDP's SDG Impact Standards as well as others, such as the Operating Principles for Impact Management. People who know how to apply these standards are increasingly in demand by institutions globally as they work to improve their performance and reporting around ESG and impact management. 

If you work or wish to work within an enterprise, a corporation, a fund that manages assets or an asset owner or advisory that oversees investment assets, or if you just want to learn more about impact investing, ESG, social finance or corporate reporting, this course will help you master the core concepts and practices in impact management for the SDGs and other impacts from both an enterprise and investor perspective.SHOW ALL COURSE OUTLINESHOW ALL",NA,NA,9,Duke University,100% onlineStart instantly and learn at your own schedule.,English-English,https://www.coursera.org/learn/impact-for-sdgs,https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera-course-photos/cd/1c7639414649329077bfce8af46fa1/UNDP-IMP_courseLOGO-transparentforWhiteBkgd.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=1&w=150&h=150&q=25&fit=fill&bg=FFF
8,Business,Private Equity and Venture Capital,"The course deals with the analysis of the private equity and venture capital business. Over the course, students will be provided with a deep understanding of the mechanism underpinning the creation and/or development of a firm and the financial support it can get from the financial system through venture capital investment.

The course tries to discover how special financial intermediaries (called private equity investors) finance through equity companies belonging to different stages of their life-cycle, starting from the very beginning (startup and early stage) to a more mature phase (i.e. expansion, mature age, etc.) or also staying into crises and decline. 

Private equity (named venture capital when the company is in the first phases of its life cycle) deals with very different activities, such as scouting, advisory, deal-making, valuation, and financing as financial intermediaries see it. 

COURSE SYLLABUS
The course is made up of four different modules: 
WEEK 1 - Introduction to Private Equity and Venture Capital
WEEK 2 - Discovering Private Equity Investors: Legal Issues and Taxation
WEEK 3 - Management of Private Equity and Venture Capital Funds
WEEK 4 - Company Valuation And Deal Making In Private Equity Settings
WEEK 5 - Final Test
Throughout the course, guest speakers and practitioners will be interviewed to provide some examples of concrete applications of the contents presented.

14,Business,Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Infrastructure,"Decentralized Finance: The Future of Finance is a set of four courses taught by Campbell R. Harvey (Professor of Finance at the Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, and a Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research) that focus on decentralized finance (DeFi). In this first course, we begin by exploring the origins of DeFi and take a broad historical view from the earliest barter economies, such as the first peer-to-peer exchanges of bartering, to present day. The course also looks at historical examples of money having value even though it is not officially backed. We then focus on the key infrastructure components: blockchain, cryptocurrency, smart contracts, oracles, stablecoins and decentralized applications (or dApps). This includes discussion of the mechanics of the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains including cryptographic hashing.  

Next, we focus on the specific problems that DeFi is designed to solve: inefficiency (costly, slow, and insecure today), limited access (1.7 billion are unbanked), opacity (we need to trust regulators to monitor banks and the regulators have mixed records), centralized control (financial system is oligopolistic imposing higher fees than we would have in a competitive market) and lack of interoperability (it is difficult to move funds from one financial institution to another today). The course closes by exploring many of the myths about the crypto space.SHOW ALL COURSE OUTLINESHOW ALL",Articulate the history and origins of decentralized finance.
